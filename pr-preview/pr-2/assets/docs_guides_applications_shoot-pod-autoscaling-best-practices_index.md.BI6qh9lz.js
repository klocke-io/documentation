HPA (implemented as part of the kube-controller-manager) scales the number of pod replicas, while VPA (implemented as independent community project) adjusts the CPU and memory requests for the pods. Both types of autoscaling aim to optimize resource usage/costs and maintain the performance and (high) availability of applications running on Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="horizontal-pod-autoscaling-hpa" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#horizontal-pod-autoscaling-hpa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Horizontal Pod Autoscaling involves increasing or decreasing the number of pod replicas in a deployment, replica set, stateful set, or <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-autoscaling/853-configurable-hpa-scale-velocity/README.md#summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anything really with a scale subresource that manages pods</a>. HPA adjusts the number of replicas based on specified metrics, such as CPU or memory average utilization (usage divided by requests; most common) or average value (usage; less common). When the demand on your application increases, HPA automatically scales out the number of pods to meet the demand. Conversely, when the demand decreases, it scales in the number of pods to reduce resource usage.</p><p>HPA targets (mostly stateless) applications where adding more instances of the application can linearly increase the ability to handle additional load. It is very useful for applications that experience variable traffic patterns, as it allows for real-time scaling without the need for manual intervention.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>HPA continuously monitors the metrics of the targeted pods and adjusts the number of replicas based on the observed metrics. It operates solely on the current metrics when it calculates the averages across all pods, meaning it reacts to the immediate resource usage without considering past trends or patterns. Also, all pods are treated equally based on the average metrics. This could potentially lead to situations where some pods are under high load while others are underutilized. Therefore, particular care must be applied to (fair) load-balancing (connection vs. request vs. actual resource load balancing are crucial).</p></div><h3 id="a-few-words-on-the-cluster-proportional-horizontal-autoscaler-cpa-and-the-cluster-proportional-vertical-autoscaler-cpva" tabindex="-1">A Few Words on the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cluster-Proportional (Horizontal) Autoscaler (CPA)</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-vertical-autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cluster-Proportional Vertical Autoscaler (CPVA)</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-few-words-on-the-cluster-proportional-horizontal-autoscaler-cpa-and-the-cluster-proportional-vertical-autoscaler-cpva" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Few Words on the [Cluster-Proportional (Horizontal) Autoscaler (CPA)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler) and the [Cluster-Proportional Vertical Autoscaler (CPVA)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-vertical-autoscaler)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Besides HPA and VPA, CPA and CPVA are further options for scaling horizontally or vertically (neither is deployed by Gardener and must be deployed by the user). Unlike HPA and VPA, CPA and CPVA do not monitor the actual pod metrics, but scale solely on the number of nodes or CPU cores in the cluster. While this approach may be helpful and sufficient in a few rare cases, it is often a risky and crude scaling scheme that we do not recommend.

Instead of changing the number of replicas, VPA tweaks the resource requests (and limits, but only <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/README.md#keeping-limit-proportional-to-request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">proportionally</a>, if configured) for the pods in a deployment, replica set, stateful set, daemon set, or <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-apply-vpa-to-my-custom-resource" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anything really with a scale subresource that manages pods</a>. This means that each pod can be given more, or fewer resources as needed.</p><p>VPA is very useful for optimizing the resource requests of pods that have dynamic resource needs over time.

Therefore, in order to apply new recommendations, pods that are &quot;out of bounds&quot; (i.e. below a configured/computed lower or above a configured/computed upper recommendation percentile) will be evicted proactively, but also pods that are &quot;within bounds&quot; may be evicted after a grace period. The corresponding higher-level replication controller will then recreate a new pod that VPA will then mutate to set the currently recommended requests (and proportional limits, if configured).</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>VPA continuously monitors all targeted pods and calculates recommendations based on their usage (one recommendation for the entire target). This calculation is influenced by configurable percentiles, with a greater emphasis on recent usage data and a gradual decrease (=decay) in the relevance of older data.

Clients must retry on disruptions, which is a reasonable ask in a highly dynamic (and self-healing) environment such as Kubernetes, but this is often not respected (or expected) by your clients (they may not know or care you run the workload in a Kubernetes cluster and have different expectations to the stability of the workload unless you communicated those through <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SLIs/SLOs/SLAs</a>).</li><li><strong>Statelessness:</strong> Is your application stateless or stateful?

Normally, you have little reason to modify them, but here is what they do:</p><ul><li><code>cpuInitializationPeriod</code>: Defines a grace period after a pod starts during which HPA won&#39;t consider CPU metrics of the pod for scaling if the pod is either not ready <strong>or</strong> it is ready, but a given CPU metric is older than the last state transition (to ready). This is to ignore CPU metrics that predate the current readiness while still in initialization to not make scaling decisions based on potentially misleading data. If the pod is ready and a CPU metric was collected after it became ready, it is considered also within this grace period.</li><li><code>initialReadinessDelay</code>: Defines another grace period after a pod starts during which HPA won&#39;t consider CPU metrics of the pod for scaling if the pod is not ready <strong>and</strong> it became not ready within this grace period (the docs/comments want to check whether the pod was ever ready, but the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f3f5dd99ac7bdc61c61c3d587575090c3473ab5a/pkg/controller/podautoscaler/replica_calculator.go#L411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code only checks whether the pod condition last transition time to not ready happened within that grace period</a> which it could have <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">from being ready or simply unknown before</a>). This is to ignore not (ever have been) ready pods while still in initialization to not make scaling decisions based on potentially misleading data. If the pod is ready, it is considered also within this grace period.</li></ul><p>So, regardless of the values of these settings, if a pod is reporting ready and it has a CPU metric from the time after it became ready, that pod and its metric will be considered. This holds true even if the pod becomes ready very early into its initialization. These settings cannot be used to &quot;black-out&quot; pods for a certain duration before being considered for scaling decisions. Instead, if it is your goal to ignore a potentially resource-intensive initialization phase that could wrongly lead to further scale-out, you would need to configure your pods to not report as ready until that resource-intensive initialization phase is over.</p></li></ul><h2 id="considerations-when-using-hpa" tabindex="-1">Considerations When Using HPA <a class="header-anchor" href="#considerations-when-using-hpa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Considerations When Using HPA&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Selection of metrics:</strong> Besides CPU and memory, HPA can also target custom or external metrics. Pick those (in addition or exclusively), if you guarantee certain SLOs in your SLAs.</li><li><strong>Targeting usage or utilization:</strong> HPA supports usage (absolute) and utilization (relative). Utilization is often preferred in simple examples, but usage is more precise and versatile.</li><li><strong>Compatibility with VPA:</strong> Care must be taken when using HPA in conjunction with VPA, as they can potentially interfere with each other&#39;s scaling decisions.</li></ul><h1 id="vertical-pod-autoscaler-vpa" tabindex="-1">Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) <a class="header-anchor" href="#vertical-pod-autoscaler-vpa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)&quot;">​</a></h1><p>VPA operates by monitoring resource metrics for all pods in a target. It computes a resource requests recommendation from the historic and current resource metrics. VPA checks the metrics at regular intervals, which can be configured by the user. Only CPU and memory are supported. If VPA detects that a pod&#39;s resource allocation is too high or too low, it may evict pods (if within the permitted disruption budget), which will trigger the creation of a new pod by the corresponding higher-level replication controller, which will then be mutated by VPA to match resource requests recommendation. This happens in three different components that work together:</p><ul><li><strong>VPA Recommender:</strong> The Recommender observes the historic and current resource metrics of pods and generates recommendations based on this data.</li><li><strong>VPA Updater:</strong> The Updater component checks the recommendations from the Recommender and decides whether any pod&#39;s resource requests need to be updated. If an update is needed, the Updater will evict the pod.</li><li><strong>VPA Admission Controller:</strong> When a pod is (re-)created, the Admission Controller modifies the pod&#39;s resource requests based on the recommendations from the Recommender. This ensures that the pod starts with the optimal amount of resources.</li></ul><p>Since VPA doesn&#39;t support in-place updates, pods will be evicted. You will want to control voluntary evictions by means of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)</a>. Please make yourself familiar with those and use them.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>PDBs will not always work as expected and can also get in your way, e.g. if the PDB is violated or would be violated, it may possibly block evictions that would actually help your workload, e.g. to get a pod out of an <code>OOMKilled</code> <code>CrashLoopBackoff</code> (if the PDB is or would be violated, not even unhealthy pods would be evicted as they could theoretically become healthy again, which VPA doesn&#39;t know). In order to overcome this issue, it is now possible (alpha since Kubernetes <code>v1.26</code> in combination with the feature gate <code>PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy</code> on the API server, beta and enabled by default since Kubernetes <code>v1.27</code>) to configure the so-called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/#unhealthy-pod-eviction-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">unhealthy pod eviction policy</a>. The default is still <code>IfHealthyBudget</code> as a change in default would have changed the behavior (as described above), but you can now also set <code>AlwaysAllow</code> at the PDB (<code>spec.unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy</code>). For more information, please check out <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this discussion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the PR</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-apps/c/_joO4swogKY?pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this document</a> and balance the pros and cons for yourself. In short, the new <code>AlwaysAllow</code> option is probably the better choice in most of the cases while <code>IfHealthyBudget</code> is useful only if you have frequent temporary transitions or for special cases where you have already implemented controllers that depend on the old behavior.</p></div><h2 id="defining-a-vpa-resource" tabindex="-1">Defining a VPA Resource <a class="header-anchor" href="#defining-a-vpa-resource" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Defining a VPA Resource&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To configure VPA, you need to create a VPA resource in your cluster.

Until they kick in, your initial resource requests apply and should be sensible.</li><li><strong>Pod Disruption:</strong> When VPA adjusts the resources for a pod, it may need to &quot;recreate&quot; the pod, which can cause temporary disruptions. This should be taken into account.</li><li><strong>Compatibility with HPA:</strong> Care must be taken when using VPA in conjunction with HPA, as they can potentially interfere with each other&#39;s scaling decisions.</li></ul><h1 id="combining-hpa-and-vpa" tabindex="-1">Combining HPA and VPA <a class="header-anchor" href="#combining-hpa-and-vpa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Combining HPA and VPA&quot;">​</a></h1><p>HPA and VPA serve different purposes and operate on different axes of scaling. HPA increases or decreases the number of pod replicas based on metrics like CPU or memory usage, effectively scaling the application out or in. VPA, on the other hand, adjusts the CPU and memory reservations of individual pods, scaling the application up or down.</p><p>When used together, these autoscalers can provide both horizontal and vertical scaling. However, they can also conflict with each other if used on the same metrics (e.g. both on CPU or both on memory). In particular, if VPA adjusts the requests, the utilization, i.e. the ratio between usage and requests, will approach 100% (for various reasons not exactly right, but for this consideration, close enough), which may trigger HPA to scale out, if it&#39;s configured to scale on utilization below 100% (often seen in simple examples), which will spread the load across more pods, which may trigger VPA again to adjust the requests to match the new pod usages.</p><p>This is a feedback loop and it stems from <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HPA&#39;s method of calculating the desired number of replicas</a>, which is:</p><p><code>desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * (currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue)]</code></p><p>If <code>desiredMetricValue</code> is utilization and VPA adjusts the requests, which changes the utilization, this may inadvertently trigger HPA and create said feedback loop. On the other hand, if <code>desiredMetricValue</code> is usage and VPA adjusts the requests now, this will have no impact on HPA anymore (HPA will always influence VPA, but we can control whether VPA influences HPA).</p><p>Therefore, to safely combine HPA and VPA, consider the following strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Configure HPA and VPA on different metrics:</strong> One way to avoid conflicts is to use HPA and VPA based on different metrics. For instance, you could configure HPA to scale based on requests per seconds (or another representative custom/external metric) and VPA to adjust CPU and memory requests. This way, each autoscaler operates independently based on its specific metric(s).</li><li><strong>Configure HPA to scale on usage, not utilization, when used with VPA:</strong> Another way to avoid conflicts is to use HPA not on average utilization (<code>averageUtilization</code>), but instead on average usage (<code>averageValue</code>) as replicas driver, which is an absolute metric (requests don&#39;t affect usage). This way, you can combine both autoscalers even on the same metrics.</li></ul><h1 id="pod-autoscaling-and-cluster-autoscaler" tabindex="-1">Pod Autoscaling and Cluster Autoscaler <a class="header-anchor" href="#pod-autoscaling-and-cluster-autoscaler" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pod Autoscaling and Cluster Autoscaler&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Autoscaling within Kubernetes can be implemented at different levels: pod autoscaling (HPA and VPA) and cluster autoscaling (CA). While pod autoscaling adjusts the number of pod replicas or their resource reservations, cluster autoscaling focuses on the number of nodes in the cluster, so that your pods can be hosted. If your workload isn&#39;t static and especially if you make use of pod autoscaling, it only works if you have sufficient node capacity available. The most effective way to do that, without running a worst-case number of nodes, is to configure burstable worker pools in your shoot spec, i.e. define a true minimum node count and a worst-case maximum node count and leave the node autoscaling to Gardener that internally uses the Cluster Autoscaler to provision and deprovision nodes as needed.</p><p>Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes by adding or removing nodes based on the demands of the workloads and the available resources. It interacts with the cloud provider&#39;s APIs to provision or deprovision nodes as needed. Cluster Autoscaler monitors the utilization of nodes and the scheduling of pods. If it detects that pods cannot be scheduled due to a lack of resources, it will trigger the addition of new nodes to the cluster. Conversely, if nodes are underutilized for some time and their pods can be placed on other nodes, it will remove those nodes to reduce costs and improve resource efficiency.</p><p>Best Practices:</p><ul><li><strong>Resource Buffering:</strong> Maintain a buffer of resources to accommodate temporary spikes in demand without waiting for node provisioning. This can be done by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">deploying pods with low priority that can be preempted when real workloads require resources</a>. This helps in faster pod scheduling and avoids delays in scaling out or up.</li><li><strong>Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs):</strong> Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PDBs</a> to ensure that during scale-down events, the availability of applications is maintained as the Cluster Autoscaler will not voluntarily evict a pod if a PDB would be violated.</li></ul><h2 id="interesting-ca-options" tabindex="-1">Interesting CA Options <a class="header-anchor"

&quot;Importance of Monitoring&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Monitoring is a critical component of autoscaling for several reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance Insights:</strong> It provides insights into how well your autoscaling strategy is meeting the performance requirements of your applications.</li><li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> It helps you understand resource utilization patterns, enabling you to optimize resource allocation and reduce waste.</li><li><strong>Cost Management:</strong> It allows you to track the cost implications of scaling actions, helping you to maintain control over your cloud spending.</li><li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> It enables you to quickly identify and address issues with autoscaling, such as unexpected scaling behavior or resource bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>To effectively monitor autoscaling, you should leverage the following tools and metrics:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://sigs.k8s.io/metrics-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>:</strong> Collects resource metrics from kubelets and provides them to HPA and VPA for autoscaling decisions (automatically provided by

decisions.</li><li><strong>Grafana/Plutono:</strong> A visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus to create dashboards for monitoring autoscaling metrics and events.</li><li><strong>Cloud Provider Tools:</strong> Most cloud providers offer native monitoring solutions that can be used to track the performance and costs associated with autoscaling.</li></ul><p>Key metrics to monitor include:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU and Memory Utilization:</strong> Track the resource utilization of your pods and nodes to understand how they correlate with scaling events.</li><li><strong>Pod Count:</strong> Monitor the number of pod replicas over time to see how HPA is responding to changes in load.</li><li><strong>Scaling Events:</strong> Keep an eye on scaling events triggered by HPA and VPA to ensure they align with expected behavior.</li><li><strong>Application Performance Metrics:</strong> Track application-specific metrics such as response times, error rates, and throughput.</li></ul><p>Based on the insights gained from monitoring, you may need to adjust your autoscaling configurations:</p><ul><li><strong>Refine Thresholds:</strong> If you notice frequent scaling actions or periods of underutilization or overutilization, adjust the thresholds used by HPA and VPA to better match the workload patterns.</li><li><strong>Update Policies:</strong> Modify VPA update policies if you observe that the current settings are causing too much or too little pod disruption.</li><li><strong>Custom Metrics:</strong> If using custom metrics, ensure they accurately reflect the load on your application and adjust them if they do not.</li><li><strong>Scaling Limits:</strong> Review and adjust the minimum and maximum scaling limits to prevent over-scaling or

href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">quality of service for pods</a>. Basically, there are 3 classes of QoS and they influence the eviction of pods when <code>kube-reserved</code> is underrun, i.e. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/#pod-selection-for-kubelet-eviction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node-level resources are running low</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#besteffort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>BestEffort</code></a>, i.e. pods where no container has CPU or memory requests or limits: <strong>Avoid them</strong> unless you have really good reasons. The kube-scheduler will place them just anywhere according to its policy, e.g. <code>balanced</code> or <code>bin-packing</code>, but whatever resources these pods consume, may bring other pods into trouble or even the kubelet and the container runtime itself, if it happens very suddenly.</li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#burstable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>Burstable</code></a>, i.e. pods where at least one container has CPU or memory requests and at least one has no limits or limits that don&#39;t match the requests: <strong>Prefer them</strong> unless you have really good reasons for the other QoS classes. Always specify proper requests or use VPA to recommend those. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#how-pods-with-resource-requests-are-scheduled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This helps the kube-scheduler to make the right scheduling decisions</a>. Not having limits will additionally provide upward resource flexibility, if the node is not under pressure.</li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#guaranteed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>Guaranteed</code></a>, i.e. pods where all containers have CPU and memory requests and equal limits: <strong>Avoid them</strong> unless you really know the limits or throttling/killing is intended. While &quot;Guaranteed&quot; sounds like something &quot;positive&quot; in the English language, this class comes with the downside, that pods will be actively CPU-throttled and will actively go OOM, even if the node is not under pressure and has excess capacity left. Worse, if containers in the pod are under VPA, their CPU requests/limits will often not be scaled up as CPU throttling will go unnoticed by VPA.</li></ul><h1 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h1><ul><li>As a rule of thumb, always set CPU and memory requests (or let VPA do that) and always avoid CPU and memory limits. <ul><li>CPU limits aren&#39;t helpful on an under-utilized node (=may result in needless outages) and even suppress the signals for VPA to act. On a nearly or fully utilized node, CPU limits are practically irrelevant as only the requests matter, which are translated into CPU shares that provide a fair use of the CPU anyway (see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CFS</a>).<br> Therefore, if you do not know the healthy range, do not set CPU limits. If you as author of the source code know its healthy range, set them to the upper threshold of that healthy range (everything above, from your knowledge of that code, is definitely an unbound busy loop or similar, which is the main reason for CPU limits, besides batch jobs where throttling is acceptable or even desired).</li><li>Memory limits may be more useful, but suffer a similar, though not as negative downside. As with CPU limits, memory limits aren&#39;t helpful on an under-utilized node (=may result in needless outages), but different than CPU limits, they result in an OOM, which triggers VPA to provide more memory suddenly (modifies the currently computed recommendations by a configurable factor, defaulting to +20%, see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/README.md#custom-memory-bump-up-after-oomkill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>).<br> Therefore, if you do not know the healthy range, do not set memory limits. If you as author of the source code know its healthy range, set them to the upper threshold of that healthy range (everything above, from your knowledge of that code, is definitely an unbound memory leak or similar, which is the main reason for memory limits)</li></ul></li><li>Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA): Use for pods that support horizontal scaling. Prefer scaling on usage, not utilization, as this is more predictable (not dependent on a second variable, namely the current requests) and conflict-free with vertical pod autoscaling (VPA).</li><li>As a rule of thumb, set the initial replicas to the 5th percentile of the actually observed replica count in production. Since HPA reacts fast, this is not as critical, but may help reduce initial load on the control plane early after deployment. However, be cautious when you update the higher-level resource not to inadvertently reset the current HPA-controlled replica count (very easy to make mistake that can lead to catastrophic loss of pods). HPA modifies the replica count directly in the spec and you do not want to overwrite that. Even if it reacts fast, it is not instant (not via a mutating webhook as VPA operates) and the damage may already be done.</li><li>As for minimum and maximum, let your high availability requirements determine the minimum and your theoretical maximum load determine the maximum, flanked with alerts to detect erroneous run-away out-scaling or the actual nearing of your practical maximum load, so that you can intervene.</li><li>Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA): Use for containers that have a significant usage (e.g. any container above 50m CPU or 100M memory) and a significant usage spread over time (by more than 2x), i.e. ignore small (e.g. side-cars) or static (e.g. Java statically allocated heap) containers, but otherwise use it to provide the resources needed on the one hand and keep the costs in check on the other hand.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, set the initial requests to the 5th percentile of the actually observed CPU resp. memory usage in production. Since VPA may need some time at first to respond and evict pods, this is especially critical early after deployment. The lower bound, below which pods will be immediately evicted, converges much faster than the upper bound, above which pods will be immediately evicted, but it isn&#39;t instant, e.g. after 5 minutes the lower bound is just at 60% of the computed lower bound; after 12 hours the upper bound is still at 300% of the computed upper bound (see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/b3a501cbe11e46bea1f8879d39c8436ef03e7139/vertical-pod-autoscaler/pkg/recommender/logic/recommender.go#L118-L143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code</a>). Unlike with HPA, you don&#39;t need to be as cautious when updating the higher-level resource in the case of VPA. As long as VPA&#39;s mutating webhook (VPA Admission Controller) is operational (which also the VPA Updater checks before evicting pods), it&#39;s generally safe to update the higher-level resource. However, if it&#39;s not up and running, any new pods that are spawned (e.g. as a consequence of a rolling update of the higher-level resource or for any other reason) will not be mutated. Instead, they will receive whatever requests are currently configured at the higher-level resource, which can lead to catastrophic resource under-reservation. Gardener deploys the VPA Admission Controller in HA - if unhealthy, it is reported under the <code>ControlPlaneHealthy</code> shoot status condition.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, for a container under VPA always specify initial resource requests for the resources which are controlled by VPA (the <code>controlledResources</code> field; by default both cpu and memory are controlled). vpa-updater evicts immediately if a container does not specify initial resource requests for a resource controlled by VPA (see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/00f627fbb9f4dfba952601d1e8c4c781eb423772/vertical-pod-autoscaler/pkg/updater/priority/priority_processor.go#L79-L86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code</a>).</li><li>As a rule of thumb, for a container under VPA do not set initial requests less than VPA&#39;s <code>minAllowed</code> or vpa-recommender&#39;s Pod minimum recommendation (<code>10m</code> and <code>10Mi</code>). In Gardener, vpa-recommender is configured to run with <code>--pod-recommendation-min-cpu-millicores=10</code> and <code>--pod-recommendation-min-memory-mb=10</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/b3a501cbe11e46bea1f8879d39c8436ef03e7139/pkg/component/autoscaling/vpa/recommender.go#L325-L326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code</a>). These values are synced with the smallest histogram bucket sizes - <code>10m</code> and <code>10M</code> (see <a href="/documentation/pr-preview/pr-2/docs/guides/applications/shoot-pod-autoscaling-best-practices/#vpa-recommender-options">VPA Recommender Options</a>). Note that the <code>--pod-recommendation-min-memory-mb</code> flag is in mebibytes, not megabytes (see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/b3a501cbe11e46bea1f8879d39c8436ef03e7139/vertical-pod-autoscaler/pkg/recommender/logic/recommender.go#L73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code</a>). If a Pod has a container under VPA with resource requests less than the VPA&#39;s <code>minAllowed</code> or <code>10m</code> and <code>10Mi</code>, the Pod will be evicted immediately. The reason is that the VPA&#39;s lower bound recommendation is set to <code>minAllowed</code> or <code>10m</code> and <code>10Mi</code>. vpa-updater evicts immediately if the container&#39;s resource requests are &quot;out of bounds&quot; (in this particular case - less than the lower bound).</li><li>If you have defined absolute limits (unrelated to the requests), configure VPA to only scale the requests or else it will proportionally scale the limits as well, which can easily become useless (way beyond the threshold of unhealthy behavior) or absurd (larger than node capacity):<div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>spec:</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>      ...</span></span></code></pre></div>If you have defined relative limits (related to the requests), the default policy to scale the limits proportionally with the requests is fine, but the gap between requests and limits must be zero for QoS <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#guaranteed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>Guaranteed</code></a> and should best be small for QoS <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#burstable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>Burstable</code></a> to avoid useless or absurd limits either, e.g. prefer limits being 5 to at most 20% larger than requests as opposed to being 100% larger or more.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, set <code>minAllowed</code> to the highest observed VPA recommendation (usually during the initialization phase or during any periodical activity) for an otherwise practically idle container, so that you avoid needless trashing (e.g. resource usage calms down over time and recommendations drop consecutively until eviction, which will then lead again to initialization or later periodical activity and higher recommendations and new evictions).<br>⚠️ You may want to provide higher <code>minAllowed</code> values, if you observe that up-scaling takes too long for CPU or memory for a too large percentile of your workload. This will get you out of the danger zone of too few resources for too many pods at the expense of providing too many resources for a few pods. Memory may react faster than CPU, because CPU throttling is not visible and memory gets aided by OOM bump-up incidents, but still, if you observe that up-scaling takes too long, you may want to increase <code>minAllowed</code> accordingly.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, set <code>maxAllowed</code> to your theoretical maximum load, flanked with alerts to detect erroneous run-away usage or the actual nearing of your practical maximum load, so that you can intervene. However, VPA can easily recommend requests larger than what is allocatable on a node, so you must either ensure large enough nodes (Gardener can scale up from zero, in case you like to <a href="https://gardener.cloud/docs/getting-started/features/cluster-autoscaler/#scaling-by-priority" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">define a low-priority worker pool with more resources</a> for very large pods) and/or cap VPA&#39;s target recommendations at the node allocatable remainder (after daemon set pods) of the largest eligible machine type (may result in under-provisioning resources for a pod) by configuring vpa-recommender&#39;s global maximum allowed resources (see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/docs/examples.md#specifying-global-maximum-allowed-resources-to-prevent-pods-from-being-unschedulable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Specifying global maximum allowed resources to prevent pods from being unschedulable</a>).

If you decide to use numbers that are set based only on observations, make sure to flank those numbers with monitoring alerts, so that you have sufficient time to investigate, revise, and readjust if necessary.</p></div><h1 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Pod autoscaling is a dynamic and complex aspect of Kubernetes, but it is also one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for maintaining efficient, reliable, and cost-effective applications. By carefully selecting the appropriate autoscaler, setting well-considered thresholds, and continuously monitoring and adjusting your strategies, you can ensure that your Kubernetes deployments are well-equipped to handle your resource demands while not over-paying for the provided resources at the same time.</p><p>As Kubernetes continues to evolve (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in-place updates</a>) and as new patterns and practices emerge, the approaches to autoscaling may also change. However, the principles discussed above will remain foundational to creating scalable and resilient Kubernetes workloads. Whether you&#39;re a developer or operations engineer, a solid understanding of pod autoscaling will be instrumental in the successful deployment and management of containerized applications.</p>`,111)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
