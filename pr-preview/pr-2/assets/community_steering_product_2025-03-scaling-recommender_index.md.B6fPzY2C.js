However, it seems unlikely to achieve that because it would complicate the kube-scheduler further (mixing in recommendations), make available the machine options to pick from (today, it only knows of/looks at existing nodes), and break the one-pod-at-a-time scheduling principle it follows today (CA and the recommender need to look at all pending pods to make a sensible recommendation). Furthermore, virtualizing the API server and ETCD is probably not much work (as seen in the PoC) because we need to implement “only” the kube-scheduler required API surface and hold the data in memory.
