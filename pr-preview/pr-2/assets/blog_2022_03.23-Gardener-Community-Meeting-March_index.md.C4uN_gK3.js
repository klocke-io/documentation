While you certainly could run the Gardener components in a minikube or kind cluster, creating shoot clusters always required to register seeds backed by cloud provider infrastructure like AWS, Azure, etc..</p><p>Consequently, developing Gardener locally was similarly complicated, and the entry barrier for new contributors was way too high.</p><p>In a previous community call (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPAisXqjoTI&amp;ab_channel=GardenerProject" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hackathon &quot;Hack The Metal&quot;</a>), we already presented a new approach for overcoming these hurdles and complexities.</p><p>Now we would like to present the <a href="/docs/gardener/extensions/provider-local/">Local Provider Extension</a> for Gardener and show how it can be used to deploy Gardener locally, allowing you to quickly get your feet wet with the project.</p><p>In this session, Tim Ebert goes through the process of setting up a local Gardener cluster. After his demonstration, Rafael Franzke showcases a different approach to building your clusters locally, which, while more complicated, offers a much faster build time.</p><p>You can find the tutorials in this community call at:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/gardener/deployment/getting_started_locally/">Deploying Gardener locally</a></li><li><a href="/docs/gardener/getting_started_locally/">Running Gardener locally</a></li></ul><p>If you are left with any questions regarding the content, you might find the answers in the questions asked and answered throughout the meeting.</p><h2 id="recording" tabindex="-1">Recording <a class="header-anchor" href="#recording" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recording&quot;">​</a></h2>',13)),i(a,{videoId:"nV_JI8YWwY4"})])}const b=r(s,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
