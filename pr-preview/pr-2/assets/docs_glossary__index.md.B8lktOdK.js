In such cases you can create a soil cluster on that infrastructure manually as a host for seed clusters. From inside the firewall, seed clusters can reach the garden cluster outside the firewall. This is possible since Gardener delegated cluster management to the <em>Gardenlet</em>.</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>virtual garden cluster</td><td>A cluster without any nodes that runs the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and stores Gardener metadata like projects, shoot resources, seed resources, secrets, and others. <br><br> The virtual garden cluster is installed on the physical garden cluster (base cluster of IaaS provider) during the installation of Gardener. Thanks to the virtual garden cluster, Gardener has full control over all Gardener metadata. This full control simplifies the support for the backup, restore, recovery, migration, relocation, or recreation of this data, because it can be implemented independently from the underlying physical garden cluster.</td><td>none</td></tr></tbody></table>',7)]))}const f=t(o,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
