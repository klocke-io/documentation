Because of this, adding support for new CPs into MCM requires merging code into MCM which may not be required for core functionalities of MCM itself. Also, for various reasons it may not be feasible for all CPs to merge their code with MCM which is an Open Source project.</p><p>Because of these reasons, it was decided that the CP&#39;s code will be moved out in separate repositories so that they can be maintained separately by the respective teams. Idea is to make MCM act as a GRPC server, and CPs as GRPC clients. The CP can register themselves with the MCM using a GRPC service exposed by the MCM. Details of this approach is discussed below.</p><h2 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1">How it works: <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How it works:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>MCM acts as GRPC server and listens on a pre-defined port 5000.

The CP passes the <code>kind</code> and the <code>APIVersion</code> which it implements, and MCM maintains an internal map for all the registered clients. A GRPC stream is returned in response which is kept open througout the life of both the processes. MCM uses this stream to communicate with the client for machine operations: <code>Create()</code>, <code>Delete()</code> or <code>List()</code>. The CP client is responsible for reading the incoming messages continuously, and based on the <code>operationType</code> parameter embedded in the message, it is supposed to take the required action. This part is already handled in the package <code>grpc/infraclient</code>. To add a new CP client, import the package, and implement the <code>ExternalDriverProvider</code> interface:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>type ExternalDriverProvider interface {</span></span>
