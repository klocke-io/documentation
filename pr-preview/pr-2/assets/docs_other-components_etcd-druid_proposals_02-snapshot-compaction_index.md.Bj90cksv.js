Backups are of two types: Full Snapshots and Incremental Snapshots.</p><h3 id="full-snapshots" tabindex="-1">Full Snapshots <a class="header-anchor" href="#full-snapshots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Full Snapshots&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Full snapshot is a snapshot of the complete database at given point in time.The size of the database keeps changing with time and typically the size is relatively large (measured in 100s of megabytes or even in gigabytes. For this reason, full snapshots are taken after some large intervals.</p><h3 id="incremental-snapshots" tabindex="-1">Incremental Snapshots <a class="header-anchor" href="#incremental-snapshots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Incremental Snapshots&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Incremental Snapshots are collection of events on Etcd database, obtained through running WATCH API Call on Etcd. After some short intervals, all the events that are accumulated through WATCH API Call are saved in a file and named as Incremental Snapshots at relatively short time intervals.</p><h3 id="recovery-from-the-snapshots" tabindex="-1">Recovery from the Snapshots <a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-from-the-snapshots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recovery from the Snapshots&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="recovery-from-full-snapshots" tabindex="-1">Recovery from Full Snapshots <a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-from-full-snapshots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recovery from Full Snapshots&quot;">​</a></h4><p>As the full snapshots are snapshots of the complete database, the whole database can be recovered from a full snapshot in one go. Etcd provides API Call to restore the database from a full snapshot file.</p><h4 id="recovery-from-incremental-snapshots" tabindex="-1">Recovery from Incremental Snapshots <a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-from-incremental-snapshots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recovery from Incremental Snapshots&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Delta snapshots are collection of retrospective Etcd events. So, to restore from Incremental snapshot file, the events from the file are needed to be applied sequentially on Etcd database through Etcd Put/Delete API calls. As it is heavily dependent on Etcd calls sequentially, restoring from Incremental Snapshot files can take long if there are numerous commands captured in Incremental Snapshot files.</p><p>Delta snapshots are applied on top of running Etcd database. So, if there is inconsistency between the state of database at the point of applying and the state of the database when the delta snapshot commands were captured, restoration will fail.</p><p>Currently, in Gardener setup, Etcd is restored from the last full snapshot and then the delta snapshots, which were captured after the last full snapshot.</p><p>The main problem with this is that the complete restoration time can be unacceptably large if the rate of change coming into the etcd database is quite high because there are large number of events in the delta snapshots to be applied sequentially. A secondary problem is that, though auto-compaction is enabled for etcd, it is not quick enough to compact all the changes from the incremental snapshots being re-applied during the relatively short period of time of restoration (as compared to the actual period of time when the incremental snapshots were accumulated). This may lead to the etcd pod (the backup-restore sidecar container, to be precise) to run out of memory and/or storage space even if it is sufficient for normal operations.</p><h2 id="solution" tabindex="-1">Solution <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Solution&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="compaction-command" tabindex="-1">Compaction command <a class="header-anchor" href="#compaction-command" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compaction command&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To help with the problem mentioned earlier, our proposal is to introduce <code>compact</code> subcommand with <code>etcdbrctl</code>. On execution of <code>compact</code> command, A separate embedded Etcd process will be started where the Etcd data will be restored from the snapstore (exactly as in the restoration scenario today). Then the new Etcd database will be compacted and defragmented using Etcd API calls. The compaction will strip off the Etcd database of old revisions as per the Etcd auto-compaction configuration. The defragmentation will free up the unused fragment memory space released after compaction. Then a full snapshot of the compacted database will be saved in snapstore which then can be used as the base snapshot during any subsequent restoration (or backup compaction).</p><h3 id="how-the-solution-works" tabindex="-1">How the solution works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-the-solution-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How the solution works&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The newly introduced compact command does not disturb the running Etcd while compacting the backup snapshots. The command is designed to run potentially separately (from the main Etcd process/container/pod). Etcd Druid can be configured to run the newly introduced compact command as a separate job (scheduled periodically) based on total number of Etcd events accumulated after the most recent full snapshot.</p><h3 id="etcd-druid-flags" tabindex="-1">Etcd-druid flags: <a class="header-anchor" href="#etcd-druid-flags" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Etcd-druid flags:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Etcd-druid introduces the following flags to configure the compaction job:</p><ul><li><code>--enable-backup-compaction</code> (default <code>false</code>): Set this flag to <code>true</code> to enable the automatic compaction of etcd backups when the threshold value denoted by CLI flag <code>--etcd-events-threshold</code> is exceeded.</li><li><code>--compaction-workers</code> (default <code>3</code>): Number of worker threads of the CompactionJob controller. The controller creates a backup compaction job if a certain etcd event threshold is reached. If compaction is enabled, the value for this flag must be greater than zero.</li><li><code>--etcd-events-threshold</code> (default <code>1000000</code>): Total number of etcd events that can be allowed before a backup compaction job is triggered.</li><li><code>--active-deadline-duration</code> (default <code>3h</code>): Duration after which a running backup compaction job will be terminated.</li><li><code>--metrics-scrape-wait-duration</code> (default <code>0s</code>): Duration to wait for after compaction job is completed, to allow Prometheus metrics to be scraped.</li></ul><h3 id="points-to-take-care-while-saving-the-compacted-snapshot" tabindex="-1"><strong>Points to take care while saving the compacted snapshot:</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#points-to-take-care-while-saving-the-compacted-snapshot" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Points to take care while saving the compacted snapshot:**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As compacted snapshot and the existing periodic full snapshots are taken by different processes running in different pods but accessing same store to save the snapshots, some problems may arise:</p><ol><li>When uploading the compacted snapshot to the snapstore, there is the problem of how does the restorer know when to start using the newly compacted snapshot. This communication needs to be atomic.</li><li>With a regular schedule for compaction that happens potentially separately from the main etcd pod, is there a need for regular scheduled full snapshots anymore?</li><li>We are planning to introduce new directory structure, under v2 prefix, for saving the snapshots (compacted and full), as mentioned in details below.

When a full snapshot is created, it is placed under a prefix/directory with the name comprising of timestamp. Then subsequent delta snapshots are also pushed into the same directory. Thus each prefix/directory contains a single full snapshot and the subsequent delta snapshots. So far, it is the job of ETCDBR to start main Etcd process and snapshotter process which takes full snapshot and delta snapshot periodically. But as per our proposal, compaction will be running as parallel process to main Etcd process and snapshotter process. So we can&#39;t reliably co-ordinate between the processes to achieve switching to the compacted snapshot as the base snapshot atomically.</p><h5 id="current-directory-structure" tabindex="-1"><strong>Current Directory Structure</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#current-directory-structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Current Directory Structure**&quot;">​</a></h5><div class="language-yaml vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">yaml</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">- </span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;">Backup-192345</span></span>
