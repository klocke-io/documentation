These meetings are essential governance bodies in the Gardener project:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Steering</strong>: Focuses on prioritization, vision, roadmap alignment, and cross-cutting concerns.</li><li><strong>Technical Steering</strong>: Focuses on architecture, technical direction, and design decisions.</li></ul><p>Each proposal in this repository aims to provide sufficient context, motivation, and a concrete ask or decision request to facilitate informed and effective discussion during the respective steering meeting.</p><h3 id="üßë‚Äçüíº-product-steering" tabindex="-1">üßë‚Äçüíº Product Steering <a class="header-anchor" href="#üßë‚Äçüíº-product-steering" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;üßë‚Äçüíº Product Steering&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Product Steering provides strategic direction for major product increments. Product ideas can be submitted to the Product Steering Committee as proposals. The proposer must provide a brief document outlining the idea. Ideally, if applicable, a prototype should be included to demonstrate feasibility, but no full implementation or design document is expected (or desired) at this stage.</p><p>So, Gardener&#39;s Product Steering discusses topics at an early stage, before substantial efforts begin.
