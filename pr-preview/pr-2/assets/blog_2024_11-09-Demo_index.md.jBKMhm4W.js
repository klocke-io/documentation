This interactive playground is designed to provide you with a hands-on experience of Gardener, our open-source project that offers a Kubernetes-based solution for managing Kubernetes clusters across various cloud providers uniformly.</p><h2 id="why-a-demo-environment" tabindex="-1">Why a Demo Environment? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-demo-environment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why a Demo Environment?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We understand that the best way to learn is by doing. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve created this demo environment. It&#39;s a space where you can experiment with Gardener, explore its features, and see firsthand how it can simplify your Kubernetes operations - all without having to install anything on your local machine.</p><p><img src="https://demo.gardener.cloud/assets/screenshot-light-3TO--vgb.png" alt="Demo"></p><h2 id="easy-access-quick-learning" tabindex="-1">Easy Access, Quick Learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#easy-access-quick-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Easy Access, Quick Learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Getting started is as simple as logging in with your GitHub account. Once you&#39;re in, you&#39;ll have access to a terminal session running a pre-configured Gardener system (based on the <a href="/docs/gardener/deployment/getting_started_locally/">local setup</a> which you can also install on your machine if preferred). This means you can dive right in and start creating and managing Kubernetes clusters. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned Kubernetes user or just starting your Kubernetes journey, this demo environment is a great way to learn about Gardener. It&#39;s designed to be intuitive and interactive, helping you learn at your own pace.</p><h2 id="discover-the-power-of-gardener" tabindex="-1">Discover the Power of Gardener <a class="header-anchor" href="#discover-the-power-of-gardener" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discover the Power of Gardener&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Gardener is all about making Kubernetes management easier and more efficient.
