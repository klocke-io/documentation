These updates bring more clarity to credential handling, a smoother experience for managing large numbers of clusters, and a move towards a more reactive interface.</p><h3 id="unified-and-enhanced-credentials-management" tabindex="-1">Unified and Enhanced Credentials Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#unified-and-enhanced-credentials-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unified and Enhanced Credentials Management&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The management of secrets and credentials has been significantly revamped for better clarity and functionality:</p><ul><li><strong>Introducing CredentialsBindings:</strong> The dashboard now fully supports <code>CredentialsBinding</code> resources alongside the existing <code>SecretBinding</code> resources. This allows for referencing both Secrets and, in the future, Workload Identities more explicitly. While <code>CredentialsBindings</code> referencing Workload Identity resources are visible for cluster creation, editing or deleting them via the dashboard is not yet supported.</li><li><strong>&quot;Credentials&quot; Page:</strong> The former &quot;Secrets&quot; page has been renamed to &quot;Credentials.&quot; It features a new &quot;Kind&quot; column and distinct icons to clearly differentiate between <code>SecretBinding</code> and <code>CredentialsBinding</code> types, especially useful when resources share names. The column showing the referenced credential resource name has been removed as this information is part of the binding&#39;s details.</li><li><strong>Contextual Information and Safeguards:</strong> When editing a secret, all its associated data is now displayed, providing better context. If an underlying secret is referenced by multiple bindings, a hint is shown to prevent unintended impacts. Deletion of a binding is prevented if the underlying secret is still in use by another binding.</li><li><strong>Simplified Creation and Editing:</strong> New secrets created via the dashboard will now automatically generate a <code>CredentialsBinding</code>. While existing <code>SecretBindings</code> remain updatable, the creation of new <code>SecretBindings</code> through the dashboard is no longer supported, encouraging the adoption of the more versatile <code>CredentialsBinding</code>. The edit dialog for secrets now pre-fills current data, allowing for easier modification of specific fields.</li><li><strong>Handling Missing Secrets:</strong> The UI now provides clear information and guidance if a <code>CredentialsBinding</code> or <code>SecretBinding</code> references a secret that no longer exists.</li></ul><h3 id="revamped-cluster-list-for-improved-scalability" tabindex="-1">Revamped Cluster List for Improved Scalability <a class="header-anchor" href="#revamped-cluster-list-for-improved-scalability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Revamped Cluster List for Improved Scalability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Navigating and managing a large number of clusters is now more efficient:</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Scrolling:</strong> The cluster list has adopted virtual scrolling. Rows are rendered dynamically as you scroll, replacing the previous pagination system. This significantly improves performance and provides a smoother browsing experience, especially for environments with hundreds or thousands of clusters.</li><li><strong>Optimized Row Display:</strong> The height of individual rows in the cluster list has been reduced, allowing more clusters to be visible on the screen at once. Additionally, expandable content within a row (like worker details or ticket labels) now has a maximum height with internal scrolling, ensuring consistent row sizes and smooth virtual scrolling performance.</li></ul><h3 id="real-time-updates-for-projects" tabindex="-1">Real-Time Updates for Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#real-time-updates-for-projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Real-Time Updates for Projects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The dashboard is becoming more dynamic with the introduction of real-time updates:</p><ul><li><strong>Instant Project Changes:</strong> Modifications to projects, such as creation or deletion, are now reflected instantly in the project list and interface without requiring a page reload. This is achieved through WebSocket communication.</li><li><strong>Foundation for Future Reactivity:</strong> This enhancement for projects lays the groundwork for bringing real-time updates to other resources within the dashboard, such as Seeds and the Garden resource, in future releases.</li></ul><h3 id="other-notable-enhancements" tabindex="-1">Other Notable Enhancements <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-notable-enhancements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Other Notable Enhancements&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Kubeconfig Update:</strong> The kubeconfig generated for garden cluster access via the &quot;Account&quot; page now uses the <code>--oidc-pkce-method</code> flag, replacing the deprecated <code>--oidc-use-pkce</code> flag. Users encountering deprecation messages should redownload their kubeconfig.</li><li><strong>Notification Behavior:</strong> Kubernetes warning notifications are now automatically dismissed after 5 seconds. However, all notifications will remain visible as long as the mouse cursor is hovering over them, giving users more time to read important messages.</li><li><strong>API Server URL Path:</strong> Support has been added for kubeconfigs that include a path in the API server URL.</li></ul><p>These updates in Gardener Dashboard 1.80 collectively enhance usability, provide better control over credentials, and improve performance for large-scale operations.</p><p>For a comprehensive list of all features, bug fixes, and contributor acknowledgments, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/releases/tag/1.80.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official release notes</a>.
