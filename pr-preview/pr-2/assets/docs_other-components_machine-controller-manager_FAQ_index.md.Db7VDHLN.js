This is configured via the <code>--target-kubeconfig</code> flag. If the flag is omitted or empty, it uses the in-cluster credentials (i.e., the pod&#39;s <code>ServiceAccount</code>).</p><p>By default, MCM works with the <code>Machine*</code> resources in the target cluster, unless a different &quot;control cluster&quot; is configured via the <code>--control-kubeconfig</code> flag. In standard <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gardener</a> <code>Shoot</code> clusters, MCM uses the <code>Seed</code> cluster as the control cluster for managing machines of the <code>Shoot</code> cluster (target cluster).</p><p>MCM can also be configured to run without a target cluster by specifying <code>--target-kubeconfig=none</code>. This requires explicitly configuring a control cluster via <code>--control-kubeconfig</code>. In this mode, MCM only provisions/deletes machines on the configured infrastructure without considering the target cluster&#39;s <code>Node</code> objects. As a consequence, MCM doesn&#39;t create bootstrap tokens, doesn&#39;t wait for <code>Nodes</code> to be registered/drained, and does not perform health checks for <code>Machines</code>. Once the machine has been successfully created in the infrastructure, <code>Machine.status.currentStatus.phase</code> transitions to <code>Available</code> as a target state (see <a href="/docs/other-components/machine-controller-manager/faq/#what-are-the-different-phases-of-a-machine">this section</a>) – in contrast to the standard <code>Pending</code> and <code>Running</code> phases. Accordingly, the owning <code>MachineSet</code> and <code>MachineDeployment</code> objects will have &quot;available&quot; replicas but no &quot;ready&quot; replicas as indicated in the corresponding status fields. This mode is used for provisioning control plane machines of <a href="/docs/gardener/deployment/getting_started_locally_with_gardenadm/">autonomous shoot clusters</a> (<code>gardenadm bootstrap</code> command, medium-touch scenario).</p><h3 id="how-to-better-control-the-rollout-process-of-the-worker-nodes" tabindex="-1">How to better control the rollout process of the worker nodes? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-better-control-the-rollout-process-of-the-worker-nodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to better control the rollout process of the worker nodes?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>MCM allows configuring the rollout of the worker machines using <code>maxSurge</code> and <code>maxUnavailable</code> fields. These fields are applicable only during the rollout process and means nothing in general scale up/down scenarios. The overall process is very similar to how the <code>Deployment Controller</code> manages pods during <code>RollingUpdate</code>.</p><ul><li><code>maxSurge</code> refers to the number of additional machines that can be added on top of the <code>Spec.Replicas</code> of MachineDeployment <em>during rollout process</em>.</li><li><code>maxUnavailable</code> refers to the number of machines that can be deleted from <code>Spec.Replicas</code> field of the MachineDeployment <em>during rollout process</em>.</li></ul><h3 id="how-to-scale-down-machinedeployment-by-selective-deletion-of-machines" tabindex="-1">How to scale down MachineDeployment by selective deletion of machines? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-scale-down-machinedeployment-by-selective-deletion-of-machines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to scale down MachineDeployment by selective deletion of machines?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>During scale down, triggered via <code>MachineDeployment</code>/<code>MachineSet</code>, MCM prefers to delete the <code>machine/s</code> which have the least priority set. Each <code>machine</code> object has an annotation <code>machinepriority.machine.sapcloud.io</code> set to <code>3</code> by default. Admin can reduce the priority of the given machines by changing the annotation value to <code>1</code>.

During force deletion, MCM skips the drain function and simply triggers the deletion of the machine. This label should be used with caution as it can violate the PDBs for pods running on the machine.</p><h3 id="how-to-pause-the-ongoing-rolling-update-of-the-machinedeployment" tabindex="-1">How to pause the ongoing rolling-update of the machinedeployment? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-pause-the-ongoing-rolling-update-of-the-machinedeployment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to pause the ongoing rolling-update of the machinedeployment?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>An ongoing rolling-update of the machine-deployment can be paused by using <code>spec.paused</code> field.

Although, few parts have been modified to make it work best in the context of MCM. Drain is executed before machine deletion for graceful migration of the applications. Drain internally uses the <code>EvictionAPI</code> to evict the pods and triggers the <code>Deletion</code> of pods after <code>MachineDrainTimeout</code>. Please note:</p><ul><li>Stateless pods are evicted in parallel.</li><li>Stateful applications (with PVCs) are serially evicted. Please find more info in this <a href="/docs/other-components/machine-controller-manager/faq/#how-are-the-stateful-applications-drained-during-machine-deletion">answer below</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="how-are-the-stateful-applications-drained-during-machine-deletion" tabindex="-1">How are the stateful applications drained during machine deletion? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-the-stateful-applications-drained-during-machine-deletion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How are the stateful applications drained during machine deletion?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Drain function serially evicts the stateful-pods. It is observed that serial eviction of stateful pods yields better overall availability of pods as the underlying cloud in most cases detaches and reattaches disks serially anyways. It is implemented in the following manner:</p><ul><li>Drain lists all the pods with attached volumes. It evicts very first stateful-pod and waits for its related entry in Node object&#39;s <code>.status.volumesAttached</code> to be removed by KCM. It does the same for all the stateful-pods.</li><li>It waits for <code>PvDetachTimeout</code> (default 2 minutes) for a given pod&#39;s PVC to be removed, else moves forward.</li></ul><h3 id="how-does-maxevictretries-configuration-work-with-draintimeout-configuration" tabindex="-1">How does <code>maxEvictRetries</code> configuration work with <code>drainTimeout</code> configuration? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-maxevictretries-configuration-work-with-draintimeout-configuration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How does \`maxEvictRetries\` configuration work with \`drainTimeout\` configuration?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It is recommended to only set <code>MachineDrainTimeout</code>.

By default, the <code>machine-health-timeout</code> is 10` minutes.</p><p><code>Failed</code> machines have their deletion timestamp set and the machine then moves to the <code>Terminating</code> phase. The node drain process is initiated. The drain process is invoked either <em>gracefully</em> or <em>forcefully</em>.</p><p>The usual drain process is graceful. Pods are evicted from the node and the drain process waits until any existing attached volumes are mounted on new node. However, if the node <code>Ready</code> is <code>False</code> or the <code>ReadonlyFilesystem</code> is <code>True</code> for greater than <code>5</code> minutes (non-configurable), then a forceful drain is initiated. In a forceful drain, pods are deleted and <code>VolumeAttachment</code> objects associated with the old node are also marked for deletion. This is followed by the deletion of the cloud provider VM associated with the <code>Machine</code> and then finally ending with the <code>Node</code> object deletion.</p><p>During the deletion of the VM we only delete the local data disks and boot disks associated with the VM. The disks associated with persistent volumes are left un-touched as their attach/de-detach, mount/unmount processes are handled by k8s attach-detach controller in conjunction with the CSI driver.</p><h1 id="troubleshooting" tabindex="-1">Troubleshooting <a class="header-anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;">​</a></h1><h3 id="my-machine-is-stuck-in-deletion-for-1-hr-why" tabindex="-1">My machine is stuck in deletion for 1 hr, why? <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-machine-is-stuck-in-deletion-for-1-hr-why" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My machine is stuck in deletion for 1 hr, why?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In most cases, the <code>Machine.Status.LastOperation</code> provides information around why a machine can&#39;t be deleted.
