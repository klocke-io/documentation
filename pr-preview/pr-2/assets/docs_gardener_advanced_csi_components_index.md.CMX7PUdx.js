In such situations, there are multiple controllers acting on the <code>VolumeSnapshot</code> custom resources (each responsible for those instances associated with their respective driver provisioner types).</p><p>However, this might lead to operational conflicts that cannot be overcome by Gardener alone. Concretely, Gardener cannot know which custom CSI components were installed by end-users which can lead to issues, especially during shoot cluster deletion. You can add a label to your custom CSI components indicating that Gardener should not try to remove them during shoot cluster deletion.
