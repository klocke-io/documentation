Due to the separation of control plane and data plane in Gardener&#39;s architecture, webhooks have the potential to break a cluster.

Depending on the scope of the webhook, frequent failures may cause downtime for applications. Common causes for failure are:</p><ul><li>The call to the webhook is made through the VPN tunnel. VPN / connection issues can happen both on the side of the seed as well as the shoot and would render the webhook unavailable from the perspective of the control plane.</li><li>The traffic cannot reach the pod (network issue, pod not available)</li><li>The pod is processing too slow (e.g., because there are too many requests)</li></ul><h3 id="timeout" tabindex="-1">Timeout <a class="header-anchor" href="#timeout" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Timeout&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="timeout"></p><p>Webhooks are a very helpful feature of Kubernetes. However, they can easily be configured to break a shoot cluster. Take the timeout, for example. High timeouts (&gt;15s) can lead to blocking requests of control plane components. That&#39;s because most control-plane API calls are made with a client-side timeout of 30s, so if a webhook has <code>timeoutSeconds=30</code>, the overall request might still fail as there is overhead in communication with the API server and other potential webhooks.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">Recommendation</p><p>Webhooks (esp. mutating) may be called sequentially and thus adding up their individual timeouts.
