You may find our <a href="/docs/guides/high-availability/best-practices/">HA Best Practices</a> helpful to get closer to that goal. In this document, we collected many options and settings for you that also Gardener internally uses to provide a highly available service.</p><p>During a zone outage, you may be forced to change your cluster setup on short notice in order to compensate for failures and shortages resulting from the outage. For instance, if the shoot cluster has worker nodes across three zones where one zone goes down, the computing power from these nodes is also gone during that time. Changing the worker pool (<code>shoot.spec.provider.workers[]</code>) and infrastructure (<code>shoot.spec.provider.infrastructureConfig</code>) configuration can eliminate this disbalance, having enough machines in healthy availability zones that can cope with the requests of your applications.</p><p>Gardener relies on a sophisticated reconciliation flow with several dependencies for which various flow steps wait for the <em>readiness</em> of prior ones. During a zone outage, this can block the entire flow, e.g., because all three <code>etcd</code> replicas can never be ready when a zone is down, and required changes mentioned above can never be accomplished. For this, a special one-off annotation <code>shoot.gardener.cloud/skip-readiness</code> helps to skip any readiness checks in the flow.</p><blockquote><p>The <code>shoot.gardener.cloud/skip-readiness</code> annotation serves as a last resort if reconciliation is stuck because of important changes during an AZ outage. Use it with caution, only in exceptional cases and after a case-by-case evaluation with your Gardener landscape administrator. If used together with other operations like Kubernetes version upgrades or credential rotation, the annotation may lead to a severe outage of your shoot control plane.</p></blockquote>`,25)]))}const g=o(n,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
