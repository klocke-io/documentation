And now we put all that into a separate, dedicated Kubernetes cluster - et voilà, we have Kubernetes in Kubernetes, aka Kubeception (named after the famous movie Inception with Leonardo DiCaprio).</p><p>In Gardener&#39;s terminology, the cluster hosting the control plane components is called a seed cluster.

The pods coming from the etcd-main StatefulSet contain two containers - one runs etcd, the other runs a program that periodically backs up etcd&#39;s contents to an object store that is set up per seed cluster to make sure no data is lost. After all, etcd is the Achilles heel of all Kubernetes clusters. The backup container is also capable of performing a restore from the object store as well as defragment and compact the etcd datastore. For performance reasons, Gardener stores Kubernetes events in a separate etcd instance. By default, events are retained for 1h but can be kept longer if defined in the <code>shoot.spec</code>.</p><p>The kube API server (often called &quot;kapi&quot;) scales both horizontally and vertically.</p><p>The kube API server is not directly exposed / reachable via its public hostname.

However, there are a few operations that require the API server to connect to the kubelet instead (e.g., for every webhook, when using kubectl exec or kubectl logs). Since every good Kubernetes cluster will have its worker nodes shielded behind firewalls to reduce the attack surface, Gardener establishes a VPN connection from the shoot&#39;s internal network to the API server in the seed. For that, every shoot, as well as every control plane namespace in the seed, have openVPN pods in them that connect to each other (with the connection being established from the shoot to the seed).</p><p><strong>Gardener Resource Manager:</strong> Tooling to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources required for cluster functionality.</p><h2 id="machines" tabindex="-1">Machines <a class="header-anchor" href="#machines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Machines&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="machines"></p><p><strong>Machine Controller Manager</strong> (aka <a href="https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MCM</a>):</p><p>The machine controller manager, which lives on the seed in a shoot&#39;s control plane namespace, is the key component responsible for provisioning and removing worker nodes for a Kubernetes cluster.

If any of these resources are modified or deleted by accident, the usual observe-analyze-act cycle will revert these potentially malicious changes back to the values that Gardener envisioned. In fact, all the components found in a shoot&#39;s kube-system namespace are ManagedResources governed by the GRM. The actual resource definition is contained in secrets (as they may contain &quot;secret&quot; data), while the ManagedResources contain a reference to the secret containing the actual resource to be deployed and reconciled. Another benefit of using ManagedResources is that when deleted, it will ensure that its resources will be cleaned up (useful if a finalizer of a resource remains for some reason).
