A simple <code>tail -f &lt;path-to-logfile&gt;</code> isn&#39;t possible. Certainly, you can use <code>kubectl logs -f &lt;pod-id&gt;</code>, but it doesn&#39;t help if you want to monitor more than one pod at a time.</p><p>This is something you really need a lot, at least if you run several instances of a pod behind a <code>deployment</code>and you don&#39;t have a log viewer service like Kibana set up.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="kubetail"></p><p>In that case, kubetail comes to the rescue. It is a small bash script that allows you to aggregate the log files of several pods at the same time in a simple way. The script is called <code>kubetail</code> and is available at <a href="https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>',5)]))}const b=a(i,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
