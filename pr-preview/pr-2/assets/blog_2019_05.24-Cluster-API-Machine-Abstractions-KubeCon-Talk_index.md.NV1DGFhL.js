We, from the <strong>Gardener</strong> team, were absolutely thrilled to share the stage and explore the powerful, declarative world of Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management.</p><p>For those who don&#39;t know, Gardener has been on a mission since <strong>2017</strong> to provide a fully managed Kubernetes experience, uniquely running customer control planes as pods within dedicated &quot;seed&quot; clusters, a.k.a. &quot;Kubeception&quot;. This approach demanded robust automation for the underlying infrastructure. To solve this, we pioneered the <a href="https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Machine Controller Manager</strong></a>, introducing the core abstractions you might recognize: <code>Machine</code>, <code>MachineSet</code>, and <code>MachineDeployment</code>. These concepts were born out of real-world needs to declaratively manage VMs and their lifecycles as if they were just another Kubernetes resource.</p><p>It&#39;s exciting to see these foundational ideas embraced and extended by the wider community through <strong>Cluster API</strong>! Our joint talk was a fantastic opportunity to showcase how these abstractions, originally developed within Gardener, now form a cornerstone of Cluster API&#39;s approach to creating, configuring, and managing Kubernetes clusters in a standardized way, across any provider. Incidentally, this also made Gardener the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/commit/00b1ead264aea6f88585559056c180771cce3815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">first adopter of the machine API</a>.</p><p>We dove into:</p><ul><li>The <strong>&quot;why&quot;</strong> behind Cluster API – the drive to stop reinventing the wheel for cluster provisioning.</li><li>The <strong>core API types</strong> (yes, including those familiar <code>Machine</code>, <code>MachineSet</code>, and <code>MachineDeployment</code> concepts!) that provide the declarative power.</li><li>How you can <strong>bootstrap</strong> Cluster API and get it managing your clusters.</li><li>The vibrant <strong>community</strong> and how everyone can get involved.</li></ul><p>This collaboration isn&#39;t just about shared code; it&#39;s about a shared vision for a more consistent, automated, and less painful Kubernetes world. Seeing Gardener&#39;s early innovations become part of a community-driven standard like Cluster API is a testament to the power of open source.</p><p>If you were there, thank you for the great questions and engagement! If you missed it, keep an eye out for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtg8jygK3Hs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recording</a>. The journey to simplify cluster management is a collective one, and we&#39;re stoked to be building that future together with SIG Cluster API and all of you!</p>',8)]))}const b=t(o,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
