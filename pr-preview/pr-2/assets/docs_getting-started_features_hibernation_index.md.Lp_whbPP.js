Others might be used for development purposes or testing during business hours only. Keeping them up and running all the time is a waste of money. Gardener can help you here with its &quot;hibernation&quot; feature. Essentially, hibernation means to shut down all components of a cluster.</p><h2 id="how-hibernation-works" tabindex="-1">How Hibernation Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-hibernation-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How Hibernation Works&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The hibernation flow for a shoot attempts to reduce the resources consumed as much as possible.

Of course, this is reflected in the shoot&#39;s spec and can also be maintained there. Before a cluster is hibernated, constraints in the shoot&#39;s status will be evaluated. There might be conditions (mostly revolving around mutating / validating webhooks) that would block a successful wake-up. In such a case, the constraint will block hibernation in the first place.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="trigger-hibernation"></p><p>To wake-up or hibernate a shoot immediately, the dashboard can be used or a patch to the shoot&#39;s spec can be applied directly.</p>',16)]))}const m=t(s,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
