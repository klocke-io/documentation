Hence, we have to be careful when adding new imports or references between our packages.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ General rule of thumb: the mentioned &quot;exported&quot; packages should be as self-contained as possible and depend on as few other packages in the repository and other projects as possible.</p></blockquote><p>In order to support that rule and automatically check compliance with that goal, we leverage <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/import-boss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">import-boss</a>. The tool checks all imports of the given packages (including transitive imports) against rules defined in <code>.import-restrictions</code> files in each directory. An import is allowed if it matches at least one allowed prefix and does not match any forbidden prefixes.</p><blockquote><p>Note: <code>&#39;&#39;</code> (the empty string) is a prefix of everything. For more details, see the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/import-boss/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">import-boss</a> topic.</p></blockquote><p><code>import-boss</code> is executed on every pull request and blocks the PR if it doesn&#39;t comply with the defined import restrictions. You can also run it locally using <code>make check</code>.</p><p>Import restrictions should be changed in the following situations:</p><ul><li>We spot a new pattern of imports across our packages that was not restricted before but makes it more difficult for other projects to depend on our &quot;exported&quot; packages. In that case, the imports should be further restricted to disallow such problematic imports, and the code/package structure should be reworked to comply with the newly given restrictions.</li><li>We want to share code between packages, but existing import restrictions prevent us from doing so. In that case, please consider what additional dependencies it will pull in, when loosening existing restrictions. Also consider possible alternatives, like code restructurings or extracting shared code into dedicated packages for minimal impact on dependent projects.</li></ul><h2 id="updating-go" tabindex="-1">Updating Go <a class="header-anchor" href="#updating-go" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Updating Go&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Go releases twice a year and supports the latest two releases (<a href="https://go.dev/s/release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ref</a>).
