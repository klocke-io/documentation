Depending on the configured zones or <a href="/documentation/pr-preview/pr-2/docs/gardener/networking/exposureclasses/">exposure classes</a>, there are different endpoints in a seed cluster. The IP address(es) can be determined by a DNS query for the API Server URL. The main entry-point into the seed cluster is the load balancer of the Istio ingress-gateway service. Depending on the infrastructure provider, there can be one IP address per zone.</p><p>The load balancer of the Istio ingress-gateway service exposes the following TCP ports:</p><ul><li><strong>443</strong> for requests to the shoot API Server. The request is dispatched according to the set TLS SNI extension.</li><li><strong>8443</strong> for requests to the shoot API Server via <code>api-server-proxy</code>, dispatched based on the proxy protocol target, which is the IP address of <code>kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local</code> in the shoot.</li><li><strong>8132</strong> to establish the reversed VPN connection.
